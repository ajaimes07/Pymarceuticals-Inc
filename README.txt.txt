Title: Pymaceuticals-Inc
Overview:Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, 
they've begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time.
Goal: Analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

This code:
* Creates a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* Creates a scatter plot that shows how the number of [metastatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis) 
(cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* Creates a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* Creates a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.

Conclusions:
 
1) 
Mice treated with ______ showed a ___% decrease in tumor volume from day 1 to 45. Whereas, Mice treated with ____ showed a ___% decrease in tumor volume from day 1 to 45. 
2) _______ showed to be effective at reducing the number of metastatic sites changes over time. Whereas _____ was the least effective. 
3) ___ mice survived 45 days of treatment. 
4) Overall, ______ seems to be the most effective treatement to decrease tumor volume.  ___ mice under that treatment showed a ____% reduccion on tumor volume.
